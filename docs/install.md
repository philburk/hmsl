# Downloading and Installing HMSL

First, download a [precompiled release](https://github.com/philburk/hmsl/releases).

1. Double click the .zip file to uncompress HMSL.
1. Drag the uncompressed "HMSL" folder to the top level "Music" folder.
1. IMPORTANT - Do not rename the HMSL folder.
1. Open the "Music/HMSL" folder and the "hmsl" folder inside it.
1. Hold down the Ctrl key and right click on the "JuceHMSL.app" icon. \*
1. Click the Open button to open the app.
1. If you do not get an "Open" button then you can open System Settings >> Privacy & Security, scroll all the way to the bottom and choose "Launch Anyway" when an app is blocked.
1. (The next time you will only have to double-click JuceHMSL.app.)
1. Hit 'y' key to initialize HMSL.
1. Wait a few seconds then hit the ENTER key.

HMSL will now be ready for use.

Next, enjoy some [guided tours of HMSL](tours/).

\* Sorry about the security issues.
I have an Apple Developer certificate and am signing the app using XCode.
But I still get these warnings. I am looking on a solution. If you have advice you can comment on #165.
