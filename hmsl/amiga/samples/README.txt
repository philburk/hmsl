There are a number of sources for IFF sample files.
If you have Deluxe Music Construction Set, you can use
its samples with HMSL.  Many samples exist in the Public
Domain.  You can also create your own samples with
a commercial sampling peripheral.  The samples
in this directory were created with a prototype Analog
to Digital converter using HMSL.
