NOTICE to PIRATES.

If you have an illegal (ie. unpaid for) copy of HMSL
(or JForth) please contact us for information on how to get
a legal copy.  The manual that comes with the purchase
of HMSL is essential for using this language.  We also
offer a Bulletin Board system for exchanging tools and
pieces with other composers.  HMSL is much more than a
manual and some disks.  It is a community of composers
who are collaborating in the exploration of new realms
of music.  Since HMSL is not "mainstream" music, we
do not expect to make much money on this.  Please
support our efforts by not making copies for friends
or accepting copies from friends.  It is theft
and hurts us.  Again, please send for a brochure from
Frog Peak to find out how to get the latest version.

NOTICE to CUSTOMERS.

Thank you for supporting this project.  Your purchase
of HMSL is greatly appreciated.

---------------------------------------------------------

Use with AMIGADOS version 1.2 and JForth V2.09 or greater.

Before you can run HMSL you will need to build
an executable image.  This requires the two JForth
disks and the HMSL disk.  Make sure you have backup disks
before attempting the build.
The detailed instructions for building HMSL can be
found in the manual.

-----------------------------------------------

Look in the HP:README file for info on the demos.

---------------------------------------------------

We hope you enjoy using HMSL.

Please let us know what your impressions of
HMSL are.  What worked and what didn't?  Was there
anything you couldn't do because of the way HMSL was
designed? Since this is an experimental language, your
feedback is very helpful.

Thank You,

Phil Burk
